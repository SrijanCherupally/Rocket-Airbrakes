# Rocket-Airbrakes

I am participating in a rocket competition. I need to build a rocket that goes to a specific altitude. However, due to wind, air pressure, humidity, and multiple other factors, it is virtually impossible to reach that altitude consistently. To solve this problem I am developing an active altitude control module that uses Active Control Airbrakes that adjust the drag of the rocket to get to the altitude very consistently.
